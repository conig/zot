      "abstractNote": "Families facing mental health challenges have very limited access to ongoing support. A formative evaluation of Families Healing Together (FHT), a new online family mental health recovery program was conducted using five waves (N=108) of data. Exploratory factor analysis of the measures identified as important to the program theory found strong reliability evidence (α=.77–.86) for 6 constructs. A poor response rate (25%) did not allow for valid pre and postoutcome evaluation, however we did have enough information to assess the psychometric properties of the new measures. The new evaluation tool accounted for 34% of the variance in Capacity to Support Family Member, and nearly 50% of the variance in Hopefulness toward Recovery. New programs without existing measures require formative evaluation strategies that accurately describe program activities in order to develop outcome measures sensitive to novel aspects of program components. Most outcome measures are developed for individuals with mental health challenges not family members. These new measures may be beneficial to effectively evaluate programs that promote family recovery and wellness.",

      "abstractNote": "Background: About 70% of teachers who instruct healthcare students are considered sessional (adjunct/temporary part-time) faculty and receive limited instruction in pedagogy. Sessional faculty may feel isolated and struggle with their teacher identity, and are often assumed to vary in their commitment, motivation, and ability to teach. However, research on teaching identity, motivations, and needs of sessional faculty is lacking. The aim of this study was to compare similarities and differences between sessional and tenure-track faculty across a health science school to guide faculty development for sessional faculty.\nMethods: We developed an online needs assessment survey, based on informal interviews and literature reviews. Seventy-eight tenure-track faculty and 160 sessional faculty completed the survey (37, 25% response rate, respectively). We used validated scales to assess intrinsic motivation, identified regulated motivation, and identification with teaching, as well as developed scales (perceived connectedness, motivated by appreciation to try new teaching method) and single items. All scales demonstrated good internal consistency. We compared sessional and tenure-track faculty using t-tests/chi-square values.\nResults: We found similarities between sessional and tenure-track faculty in intrinsic motivation, identified regulated motivation, and identification with teaching. However, sessional faculty perceived less department connectedness and were more motivated to improve instruction if shown appreciation for trying new teaching methods. Sessional faculty agreed more that they desired pedagogy instruction before starting to teach and that teachers should invest energy in improving their teaching. Admitting to less participation in activities to enhance teaching in the last year, sessional faculty were more interested in digital formats of faculty development.\nConclusion: Our comparison suggested that sessional faculty value being a teacher as part of their self, similar to tenured faculty, but desired more appreciation for efforts to improve and perceived less connectedness to their university department than tenured faculty. They also preferred digital formats for pedagogy to improve accessibility, prior to and throughout their teaching career to support their development as teachers. Using this information as a guide, we provide suggestions for faculty development for sessional faculty. Supporting sessional faculty in the health sciences should improve the quality of teaching and positively affect student learning.",

By establishing whether factor loadings, intercepts and residual variances are equivalent in a factor model that measures a latent concept, we can assure that comparisons that are made on the latent variable are valid across groups or time. Establishing measurement invariance involves running a set of increasingly constrained Structural Equation Models, and testing whether differences between these models are significant. This paper provides a step-by-step guide in analyzing Measurement Invariance.",

      "abstractNote": "Numerous researchers have discussed the potentially detrimental role that anxiety can play in thwarting positive student outcomes in higher education. Statistics anxiety, in particular, has been shown to pose a threat to statistics achievement. Although some previous researchers have demonstrated that statistics anxiety was directly related to impaired statistics performance, other researchers failed to identify such a relationship. Building from these inconsistencies in the literature, the present exploratory study used path analysis to investigate whether anxiety directly or indirectly impairs performance and its relationship with self-efficacy. In this study, we replicated previous findings that self-efficacy can predict a significant amount of the variability in statistics performance (β = .45, p = .001, adjusted R2 = .21), even after controlling for students’ prior GPAs. More importantly, through this study, we also demonstrated that anxiety did not directly impact performance (β = .23, p = .102), but instead altered students’ levels of self-efficacy (β = -.65, p = .001), and indirectly affected academic outcomes (β = -.30, p = .001). The results of this study provide evidence that students have the ability to gain the skills they need to succeed, even if they have a challenging academic history or heightened levels of anxiety. These results align with much of the previous literature, suggesting that classroom interventions at the undergraduate level should center less on decreasing student anxiety and more on instilling in students a sense of self-efficacy: the belief that, with effort and persistence, they can succeed in their statistics courses.",

Preserving Creswell's signature writing style, the authors compare the approaches and relate research designs to each of the traditions of inquiry in a highly accessible manner. Featuring new content, articles, pedagogy, references, and expanded coverage of ethics throughout, the Fourth Edition is an ideal introduction to the theories, strategies, and practices of qualitative inquiry.",

Undergraduates (407) completed the Motivated Strategies Learning Questionnaire, Implicit Theories of Intelligence Scale, Achievement Goal Inventory, and self-reported grade point average. A MANCOVA (controlling for sex and age) indicated that low self-efficacy students tended to believe intelligence is innate and unchangeable and high self-efficacy students pursued mastery goals involving challenge and gaining new knowledge as well as performance goals involving good grades and outperforming others. Further, hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated that self-efficacy, effort regulation, and help-seeking predicted 18% of the variance in GPA. Interestingly, effort regulation partially mediated the relationship between self-efficacy and GPA. Overall, self-efficacious students are able to achieve academically because they monitor and self-regulate their impulses and persist in the face of difficulties. We discuss implications of these findings for educators seeking to strengthen both self-efficacy and effort regulation towards increasing academic achievement.",

      "abstractNote": "Model comparison is one useful approach in applications of structural equation modeling. Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) are commonly used for selecting an optimal model from the alternatives. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of various model selection criteria, including AIC, BIC, and their extensions, in selecting an optimal path model under a wide range of conditions over different compositions of candidate set, distinct values of misspecified parameters, and diverse sample sizes. The chance of selecting an optimal model rose as the values of misspecified parameters and sample sizes increased. The relative performance of AIC and BIC type criteria depended on the magnitudes of the parameter misspecified. The BIC family in general outperformed AIC counterparts unless under small values of omitted parameters and sample sizes, where AIC performed better. Scaled unit information prior BIC (SPBIC) and Haughton's BIC (HBIC) demonstrated the highest accuracy ratios across most of the conditions investigated in this simulation.",

Continuing the tradition of using real data examples from a variety of disciplines, the significantly revised fourth edition incorporates recent developments such as Pearl&#39;s graphing theory and the structural causal model (SCM), measurement invariance, and more. Readers gain a comprehensive understanding of all phases of SEM, from data collection and screening to the interpretation and reporting of the results. Learning is enhanced by exercises with answers, rules to remember, and topic boxes. The companion website supplies data, syntax, and output for the book&#39;s examples–now including files for Amos, EQS, LISREL, Mplus, Stata, and R (lavaan). New to This Edition *Extensively revised to cover important new topics: Pearl&#39;s graphing theory and the SCM, causal inference frameworks, conditional process modeling, path models for longitudinal data, item response theory, and more. *Chapters on best practices in all stages of SEM, measurement invariance in confirmatory factor analysis, and significance testing issues and bootstrapping. *Expanded coverage of psychometrics. *Additional computer tools: online files for all detailed examples, previously provided in EQS, LISREL, and Mplus, are now also given in Amos, Stata, and R (lavaan). *Reorganized to cover the specification, identification, and analysis of observed variable models separately from latent variable models. Pedagogical Features *Exercises with answers, plus end-of-chapter annotated lists of further reading. *Real examples of troublesome data, demonstrating how to handle typical problems in analyses. *Topic boxes on specialized issues, such as causes of nonpositive definite correlations. *Boxed rules to remember. *Website promoting a learn-by-doing approach, including syntax and data files for six widely used SEM computer tools.",

EFA and CFA are widely used in measurement applications for construct validation and scale refinement. One of the more critical aspects of any CFA or EFA is communicating results. This work described reporting essentials of EFA with goodness of fit indices and CFA research when they are used to validate a measurement instrument with continuous variables in a different population from the one originally created. An overview of the minimum information to be reported is included along with short extracts from real published reports. For each reported section basic information to be included is described along with an example-extract adapted from published factor analysis construct validation studies. Additional issues covered include: Cross-validation, Measurement Invariance across Age and Gender, Reliability (α and ω), AVE-Based Validity, Convergent and Discriminant Validity with Correlation Analysis and Normative Data. Properly reported EFA and CFA could contribute to the improvement of the quality of the measurement instruments. A summary of good practices in CFA and SEM reporting based on literature is also included.",

Although computer self-efﬁcacy is important in online learning, researchers have generally agreed that online learning entails self-efﬁcacy of multifaceted dimensions; therefore, one of the purposes of the current study was to identify dimensions of online learning self-efﬁcacy. Through exploratory factor analysis, we identiﬁed ﬁve dimensions of online learning self-efﬁcacy: (a) self-efﬁcacy to complete an online course, (b) self-efﬁcacy to interact socially with classmates, (c) self-efﬁcacy to handle tools in a Course Management System (CMS), (d) self-efﬁcacy to interact with instructors in an online course, and (e) self-efﬁcacy to interact with classmates for academic purposes. In addition, the role of demographic variables in online learning self-efﬁcacy was investigated. Demographic variables, such as the number of online courses taken, gender, and academic status were found to predict online learning self-efﬁcacy. Furthermore, we found that online learning self-efﬁcacy predicted students' online learning satisfaction. Results are discussed, and implications for online teaching and learning are provided.",

      "abstractNote": "Most studies of eating disorders (ED) among adolescents have relied on the use of self-report questionnaires given its cost-effectiveness compared to interviews approaches. The Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) is one of the most commonly used self-report measures of eating psychopathology, despite issues regarding the underlying latent structure and its validity in this population. Given the lack of validated measures among Hispanic clinical samples, the current study aimed to validate previously suggested models for the adolescent version (EDE-Q-A) among female teenage patients with ED in Spain (Mage=15.45, SD=1.59). Results from confirmatory factor analyses failed to replicate the theoretical 4-factor structure, and a 2-factor model previously validated in a Hispanic-American community sample showed best fit over a 3-factor and a single-factor models. Excellent levels of internal consistency were observed for the two dimensions of the retained model and for the Global Score of the EDE-Q-A. Significant correlations with well established measures of ED (Eating Disorders Inventory; EDI-2) and self-esteem are presented as evidence for convergent and concurrent validity. Sensitivity analyses showed a similar patter of association between the retained model of the EDE-Q-A and the EDI-2. Current findings may contribute to development of evidence-based knowledge on ED among Hispanic clinical populations.",

      "abstractNote": "Sufﬁcient knowledge is available about the deﬁnition, details and differences of qualitative content and thematic analysis as two approaches of qualitative descriptive research. However, identifying the main features of theme as the data analysis product and the method of its development remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to describe the meaning of theme and offer a method on theme construction that can be used by qualitative content analysis and thematic analysis researchers in line with the underpinning speciﬁc approach to data analysis. This methodological paper comprises an analytical overview of qualitative descriptive research products and the meaning of theme. Also, our practical experiences of qualitative analysis supported by relevant published literature informed the generation of a stage like model of theme construction for qualitative content analysis and thematic analysis. This paper comprises: (i) analytical importance of theme, (ii) meaning of theme, (iii) meaning of category, (iv) theme and category in terms of level of content, and (v) theme development. This paper offers a conceptual clariﬁcation and a pragmatic step by step method of theme development that has the capacity of assisting nurse researchers understand how theme is developed. As nursing is a pragmatic discipline, nurse researchers have tried to develop practical ﬁndings and devise some way to “do something” with ﬁndings to enhance the action and impact of nursing. The application of a precise method of theme development for qualitative descriptive data analysis suggested in this paper helps yield meaningful, credible and practical results for nursing.",

      "abstractNote": "Appreciation of the importance of statistics literacy for citizens of a democracy has resulted in an increasing number of degree programs making statistics courses mandatory for university students. Unfortunately, empirical evidence suggests that students in nonmathematical disciplines (e.g., social sciences) regard statistics courses as the most anxiety-inducing course in their degree programs. Although a literature review exists for statistics anxiety, it was done more than a decade ago, and newer studies have since added findings for consideration. In this article, we provide a current review of the statistics anxiety literature. Specifically, related variables, definitions, and measures of statistics anxiety are reviewed with the goal of refining the statistics anxiety construct. Antecedents, effects, and interventions of statistics anxiety are also reviewed to provide recommendations for statistics instructors and for a new research agenda.",

      "abstractNote": "In spite of the high failure rate of Latinx students in developmental courses taught at community colleges in the United States, little is known about how mathematical instruction contributes to this problem. Less is known about how adjunct instructors teach these courses or about their students’ accounts of their experiences. This dissertation investigated instruction in a developmental mathematics course taught by an adjunct faculty at a Hispanic-serving community college by (1) describing the student-instructor, student-student, instructor-content, and student-content interactions (Cohen, Raudenbush, & Ball, 2003); (2) documenting student perceptions of those interactions, their instructional experiences; and (3) analyzing the way in which these varied interactions and perceptions could be explained by the wealths students brought to the course (Yosso, 2005) and the systems in which students were situated (Bronfenbrenner, 1977; 1994). Three modes of instruction were enacted in the course, lecture (the most common), individual student work time, and student presentations. The instructor led the student-instructor interactions by checking, correcting, or validating students’ work. Student- student interactions occurred only when students compared answers. The instructor-content interactions revealed mathematics as a disjoint set of problems solved with prescribed sets of steps. The student-content interactions consisted of practicing work already demonstrated by the instructor. Students’ instructional experiences described a caring instructor who wanted them to succeed and hoped for more time to explore and practice problems and less time watching their instructor lecture, more interaction with peers, and more support to create a classroom community. The microsystems in which students were situated—school, work, and home— xiv influenced one another; various exosystems—instructor’s teaching experience, supports available from the mathematics department for adjunct faculty, adjunct instructor’s out of class obligations, and departmental course scheduling—had direct and indirect effects on instruction and on the students’ instructional experiences and mediated the ways that students and the instructor adapted to and interacted with each other during instruction. Students’ reported levels of aspirational, navigational, and social wealth interacted in ways that seem to influence their course outcomes: students with narrow aspirational wealth but broad navigational and social wealth knew how to find supports and balance the demands of the course whereas students with broader aspirational wealth and narrower navigational and social wealth thought that by attending the course and doing what was expected would result in positive outcomes. These demonstrations of cultural wealth aligned with the course outcomes: students in the first group who subverted the classroom cultural norms and pressed for changes passed; students in the second group who tended to align to and accept the classroom cultural norms failed. Thus, merely attending class and doing the work as instructors ask students to do may not be sufficient to pass a developmental class. The indirect influences of the exosystems require students to develop broader levels of social and navigational capital in order to be successful; this can be done by repeating college courses, an undesirable path or by providing explicit support to broaden students’ navigational and social wealth. Engaging students during instruction could support these efforts, making explicit the supports and resources necessary to succeed. Finally, mathematics departments might need to re-evaluate the content of developmental courses and provide more and varied opportunities for adjunct faculty to receive support while teaching these courses.",

      "abstractNote": "Psychology has recently been viewed as facing a replication crisis because efforts to replicate past study ﬁndings frequently do not show the same result. Often, the ﬁrst study showed a statistically signiﬁcant result but the replication does not. Questions then arise about whether the ﬁrst study results were false positives, and whether the replication study correctly indicates that there is truly no effect after all. This article suggests these so-called failures to replicate may not be failures at all, but rather are the result of low statistical power in single replication studies, and the result of failure to appreciate the need for multiple replications in order to have enough power to identify true effects. We provide examples of these power problems and suggest some solutions using Bayesian statistics and metaanalysis. Although the need for multiple replication studies may frustrate those who would prefer quick answers to psychology’s alleged crisis, the large sample sizes typically needed to provide ﬁrm evidence will almost always require concerted efforts from multiple investigators. As a result, it remains to be seen how many of the recently claimed failures to replicate will be supported or instead may turn out to be artifacts of inadequate sample sizes and single study replications.",

      "abstractNote": "Adjunct faculty members have become the dominant faculty demographic in American higher education, as the majority of all new faculty appointments are now part-time. Despite this, there remains a lack of comprehensive data regarding the adjunct experience, particularly in regards to specific subgroups of adjunct faculty. While some adjuncts function as replacements for fulltime faculty, adjunct practitioners have a unique value-add in that they bring professional knowledge and field experience into the classroom. For this reason, they play an integral role in practice-based programs. In order to become successful instructors, they must be supported by the administration and integrated into the academic community; however, much about the experience of this group is unknown. Therefore the purpose of this qualitative case study was to gain insight into the experience of adjunct practitioners. Using Kahn’s (1990) theory of employee engagement, this study sought to answer the following research question: How do adjunct practitioners experience engagement at a mid-sized private university on the West Coast? Data gathered from interviews and a document review produced four key findings: first, participants feel teaching is personally meaningful, though they lack a sense of community with other faculty and the institution as a whole. Second, participants do not feel entirely secure in their roles and are concerned about their future security with the institution. And third, participants believe they possess the necessary basic resources to perform their role, but would appreciate more accessible development opportunities. Implications for practice and recommendations for future research are also discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "Rule-governed behavior is a central concept to explain complex human behavior from a functional-analytic standpoint. Recently, a self-report measure of a functional type of rule-following called generalized pliance has been developed – the Generalized Pliance Questionnaire (GPQ). The GPQ has two versions with 18 and 9 items, respectively. This study aimed to analyze the factor structure and psychometric properties of both GPQ versions in a Spanish online sample (N = 846). Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the one-factor model obtained an acceptable fit in the GPQ-18, but an inadequate fit in the GPQ-9. The GPQ-18 showed measurement invariance across gender, excellent internal consistency, and convergent construct validity. According to the results, the GPQ-18 showed good psychometric properties in Spanish samples. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)",

Although this looks like a rejection, this paper argues that by including multivariate thinking and – more importantly – confounding as recommended topics in introductory statistics, statistical literacy has in fact been accepted if not promoted. The adoption of the new guidelines will greatly advance students’ statistical literacy: the ability to read and interpret statistics relevant to consumers and decision makers.",

      "abstractNote": "Twenty-nine teams involving 61 analysts used the same data set to address the same research question: whether soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to dark-skin-toned players than to light-skin-toned players. Analytic approaches varied widely across the teams, and the estimated effect sizes ranged from 0.89 to 2.93 (Mdn = 1.31) in odds-ratio units. Twenty teams (69%) found a statistically significant positive effect, and 9 teams (31%) did not observe a significant relationship. Overall, the 29 different analyses used 21 unique combinations of covariates. Neither analysts’ prior beliefs about the effect of interest nor their level of expertise readily explained the variation in the outcomes of the analyses. Peer ratings of the quality of the analyses also did not account for the variability. These findings suggest that significant variation in the results of analyses of complex data may be difficult to avoid, even by experts with honest intentions. Crowdsourcing data analysis, a strategy in which numerous research teams are recruited to simultaneously investigate the same research question, makes transparent how defensible, yet subjective, analytic choices influence research results.",

      "abstractNote": "This study explores the usefulness of reflexive photography for qualitative research in the human and social sciences. The investigation was done in the context of how male academics construct their world in a university during transformation. A group of white, male academics in the human sciences were provided with a camera and were requested to take pictures of the most mean-ingful aspects of their work environment. Thereafter photo-elicitation interviews were conducted, transcribed and analysed. The study illustrates the usefulness of reflexive photography to determine human interpretation of interaction with the environment. Participants commented positively on and helped to identify the advantages and limitations of the technique. The research indicated that photographs have no intrinsic meaning but serve as symbols of meaning that participants explain during interviews. Content analysis, a second level of analysis that is based on the first level, is useful in some ways as indicated.",

The SATS was administered to Italian-speaking undergraduate students enrolled in introductory statistics courses. A conﬁrmatory factor analysis validated the four-factor structure of the scale, and good indices for both reliability and validity were obtained. A multi-group analysis conﬁrmed the time invariance (beginning vs. end of the course) of the SATS, with a minor exception. Given the invariance across time, latent mean structures analysis revealed small to large signiﬁcant changes in the four attitude dimensions. The present study provided evidence for the validity and reliability of the SATS when applied to the Italian learning framework.",

Adult Learning Theory provided the theoretical framework for the study. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted with seven adjuncts from the College of Arts and Sciences at a private, four‐year university in New England. The transcripts were analyzed using interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) and four major findings emerged from the analytic process: (a) the participants demonstrated a limited understanding of the principles of learner‐centered pedagogy; (b) the participants demonstrated a limited use of learner‐centered instructional practices; (c) institutional factors impacted their capacity to learn and apply learner‐centered teaching; and (d) the participants were characterized by adjunct types that reflected the unique needs and interests of each cohort relative to teaching and learning. These findings were examined within the context of the framework of Adult Learning Theory and situated within the extant literature. They suggest opportunities for enhancing adjuncts’ understanding and application of learner‐centered pedagogy to enhance their teaching effectiveness and to improve student learning outcomes.",

This article describes how human resource development (HRD) researchers can use canonical commonality analysis to interpret their canonical functions more completely and thereby inform theory. Using the correlation matrix, we conducted a secondary analysis of data from the Dimensions of Learning Organizational Questionnaire (DLOQ) to illustrate the utility of canonical commonality analysis. Researchers will see how canonical commonality analysis can bring to light theoretically relevant relationships in canonical functions that might be left undetected by only examining function and structure coefficients.",

The sample consisted of 1318 students enrolled in Intermediate Algebra classes at a community college. Multivariate analyses revealed that faculty employment status (full time or part time) was not associated with students' final grades or completion rates. Faculty education level was correlated with coursefinal grades, with faculty possessing graduate degrees having better student outcomes. Student gender, race, and age were associated with outcomes; semester hours attempted were not. These findings should help equip administrators to make informed decisions regardingfaculty assignments that lead to improved student outcomes and help faculty to target interventions for \"at-risk\" students.",

      "abstractNote": "The (latest) crisis in conﬁdence in social psychology has generated much heated discussion about the importance of replication, including how it should be carried out as well as interpreted by scholars in the ﬁeld. For example, what does it mean if a replication attempt “fails”—does it mean that the original results, or the theory that predicted them, have been falsiﬁed? And how should “failed” replications affect our belief in the validity of the original research? In this paper, we consider the replication debate from a historical and philosophical perspective, and provide a conceptual analysis of both replication and falsiﬁcation as they pertain to this important discussion. Along the way, we highlight the importance of auxiliary assumptions (for both testing theories and attempting replications), and introduce a Bayesian framework for assessing “failed” replications in terms of how they should affect our conﬁdence in original ﬁndings.",

      "abstractNote": "The reform movement in statistics education has led to a revitalization of the undergraduate introductory statistics course. However, many students satisfy their degree requirements by taking statistics courses in “client departments” such as business, the social sciences, and the lab sciences, typically taught by nonstatisticians. This article presents the findings of a metasynthesis of the existing literature on teaching statistics in these client disciplines to learn (1) what is currently being taught and how, and (2) the most important challenges for statistics teachers in other departments. Articles were reviewed using qualitative axial coding and quantitative text analysis to identify common research themes and ideas in the literature for each discipline. Research themes, attitudes toward statistics instruction, and pedagogical techniques were found to vary from discipline to discipline. Collaboration with instructors in other disciplines may be a welcome step toward improving statistics instruction across the university.",

      "abstractNote": "Statistical analysis is error prone. A best practice for researchers using statistics would therefore be to share data among co-authors, allowing double-checking of executed tasks just as co-pilots do in aviation. To document the extent to which this ‘co-piloting’ currently occurs in psychology, we surveyed the authors of 697 articles published in six top psychology journals and asked them whether they had collaborated on four aspects of analyzing data and reporting results, and whether the described data had been shared between the authors. We acquired responses for 49.6% of the articles and found that co-piloting on statistical analysis and reporting results is quite uncommon among psychologists, while data sharing among co-authors seems reasonably but not completely standard. We then used an automated procedure to study the prevalence of statistical reporting errors in the articles in our sample and examined the relationship between reporting errors and co-piloting. Overall, 63% of the articles contained at least one p-value that was inconsistent with the reported test statistic and the accompanying degrees of freedom, and 20% of the articles contained at least one p-value that was inconsistent to such a degree that it may have affected decisions about statistical significance. Overall, the probability that a given p-value was inconsistent was over 10%. Co-piloting was not found to be associated with reporting errors.",

      "abstractNote": "Introduction Pain management is a complex process that is managed through a multi-disciplinary team in which nurses have a significant role. The present study aimed at translating and examining the psychometric properties of the Pain Management Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PMSEQ) among Iranian nurses. Methods This was a cross-sectional, methodological study conducted in 2019 among nurses working in two teaching hospitals in Sanandaj (Tohid and Kosar). The participants were selected using a convenience sampling method. Responsiveness; interpretability; and face, content, and construct validities were examined using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. In addition, internal consistency and stability were examined using the Cronbach’s alpha and test-retest, respectively. Results Overall, 410 nurses (210 for the EFA and 200 for the CFA) were included in the sample. In the exploratory factor analysis, two factors of comprehensive pain assessment and pain management with eigenvalues of 6.36 and 1.91, respectively, were extracted. The two factors together explained 56.64% of the variance of nurses’ pain management self-efficacy. The confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the model had a moderate fit to the data (RMSEA: 0.12; NFI: 0.84; NNFI: 0.86; CFI: 0.88; IFI: 0.88; RFI: 0.81; GFI: 0.76; AGFI: 0.69; PGFI: 0.59; RMR: 0.09; standardized RMR: 0.09). Total questionnaire and the two factors (i.e. comprehensive pain assessment and pain management) had internal consistency coefficients of 0.891, 0.876, and 0.803, respectively. Conclusion The Farsi version of PMSEQ had good internal consistency and reliability, as well as content and construct validity, and can be used in future studies.",

      "abstractNote": "Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) is a powerful and commonly-used tool for investigating the underlying variable structure of a psychometric instrument. However, there is much controversy in the social sciences with regard to the techniques used in EFA (Ford, MacCallum, & Tait, 1986; Henson & Roberts, 2006) and the reliability of the outcome. Simulations by Costello and Osborne (2005), for example, demonstrate how poorly some EFA analyses replicate, even with clear underlying factor structures and large samples. Thus, we argue that researchers should routinely examine the stability or volatility of their EFA solutions to gain more insight into the robustness of their solutions and insight into how to improve their instruments while still at the exploratory stage of development.

These barriers affected the ability of part-time faculty to optimally perform their duties, depending on their individual situation. The barriers were for the most part institutional and structural and needed to be addressed at the institutional level.",

      "abstractNote": "Methods: The participants (11 physical therapy sessional educators: four clinical; seven clinical, and classroom) took part in three focus groups. We based the interview guide questions on previous survey results, used a critical theory research paradigm and performed thematic analysis.\nResults: We identified four emerging differences between physical therapy sessional educators with experience in the classroom and clinic. Classroom sessional educators needed: (a) more connectedness; (b) more appreciation; (c) more access to the learning management system, and (d) both different and similar faculty development when compared to clinical sessional educators. Differences were greater in classroom sessional educators who taught more hours. We also saw similarities in the need for feedback on teaching, orientations and communication, a better salary and clinical workplace support their role of an educator. Suggestions for context-dependent support for sessional educators were designed to address these similarities and differences.\nConclusions: Talking to various types of sessional educators about their teaching needs is the first step in providing effective faculty development. Varying needs for connectedness, appreciation, pedagogy and access to the learning management system amongst physical therapy sessional educators highlighted the need for an investment in classroom educators who teach multiple hours and want to grow as health science educators. Differences between classroom and clinical sessional educators brought to the forefront the importance of individualised, contextual faculty development and administrative or departmental action that supports sessional educators. The resulting context-dependent suggestions for improvement of support of sessional educators have the potential to improve the quality of health science teaching overall.",

      "abstractNote": "Self-efﬁcacy is believed to be a key component in successful online learning; however, most existing studies of online self-efﬁcacy focus on the computer. Although computer self-efﬁcacy is important in online learning, researchers have generally agreed that online learning entails self-efﬁcacy of multifaceted dimensions; therefore, one of the purposes of the current study was to identify dimensions of online learning self-efﬁcacy. Through exploratory factor analysis, we identiﬁed ﬁve dimensions of online learning self-efﬁcacy: (a) self-efﬁcacy to complete an online course, (b) self-efﬁcacy to interact socially with classmates, (c) self-efﬁcacy to handle tools in a Course Management System (CMS), (d) self-efﬁcacy to interact with instructors in an online course, and (e) self-efﬁcacy to interact with classmates for academic purposes. In addition, the role of demographic variables in online learning self-efﬁcacy was investigated. Demographic variables, such as the number of online courses taken, gender, and academic status were found to predict online learning self-efﬁcacy. Furthermore, we found that online learning self-efﬁcacy predicted students' online learning satisfaction. Results are discussed, and implications for online teaching and learning are provided.",

      "abstractNote": "We developed measures of current statistics self-efficacy (CSSE) and self-efficacy to learn statistics (SELS) to address whether statistics self-efficacy is related to statistics performance, and whether self-efficacy for statistics increases during an introductory statistics course. Both instruments yielded reliable, one-factor solutions that were related positively to each other and to two measures of statistics performance (i.e., specific statistics problems and overall course performance). The CSSE and SELS also were related positively to math self-efficacy and attitudes towards statistics, but related negatively to anxiety. Changes between two different testing occasions using the CSSE indicated that statistics self-efficacy increased almost two standard deviations over a 12-week instructional period.",

      "abstractNote": "Methods: The participants (11 physical therapy sessional educators: four clinical; seven clinical, and classroom) took part in three focus groups. We based the interview guide questions on previous survey results, used a critical theory research paradigm and performed thematic analysis. Results: We identified four emerging differences between physical therapy sessional educators with experience in the classroom and clinic. Classroom sessional educators needed: (a) more connectedness; (b) more appreciation; (c) more access to the learning management system, and (d) both different and similar faculty development when compared to clinical sessional educators. Differences were greater in classroom sessional educators who taught more hours. We also saw similarities in the need for feedback on teaching, orientations and communication, a better salary and clinical workplace support their role of an educator. Suggestions for context-dependent support for sessional educators were designed to address these similarities and differences. Conclusions: Talking to various types of sessional educators about their teaching needs is the first step in providing effective faculty development. Varying needs for connectedness, appreciation, pedagogy and access to the learning management system amongst physical therapy sessional educators highlighted the need for an investment in classroom educators who teach multiple hours and want to grow as health science educators. Differences between classroom and clinical sessional educators brought to the forefront the importance of individualised, contextual faculty development and administrative or departmental action that supports sessional educators. The resulting context-dependent suggestions for improvement of support of sessional educators have the potential to improve the quality of health science teaching overall.",

      "abstractNote": "Twenty-nine teams involving 61 analysts used the same data set to address the same research question: whether soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to dark-skin-toned players than to light-skin-toned players. Analytic approaches varied widely across the teams, and the estimated effect sizes ranged from 0.89 to 2.93 (Mdn = 1.31) in odds-ratio units. Twenty teams (69%) found a statistically significant positive effect, and 9 teams (31%) did not observe a significant relationship. Overall, the 29 different analyses used 21 unique combinations of covariates. Neither analysts’ prior beliefs about the effect of interest nor their level of expertise readily explained the variation in the outcomes of the analyses. Peer ratings of the quality of the analyses also did not account for the variability. These findings suggest that significant variation in the results of analyses of complex data may be difficult to avoid, even by experts with honest intentions. Crowdsourcing data analysis, a strategy in which numerous research teams are recruited to simultaneously investigate the same research question, makes transparent how defensible, yet subjective, analytic choices influence research results.",

Poth explore the philosophical underpinnings, history, and key elements of five qualitative inquiry approaches: narrative research, phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, and case study. Preserving Creswell's signature writing style, the authors compare the approaches and relate research designs to each of the traditions of inquiry in a highly accessible manner. Featuring new content, articles, pedagogy, references, and expanded coverage of ethics throughout, the Fourth Edition is an ideal introduction to the theories, strategies, and practices of qualitative inquiry.",

Para un mayor desempeño en el aprendizaje de esta materia pensando en los futuros médicos, es crucial el análisis de la ansiedad experimentada por el estudiante de medicina durante la formación en esta materia en el grado.Objetivos:Documentar la ansiedad hacia la estadística experimentada por los estudiantes de Grado en Medicina y evaluar su relación con el desempeño en la materia de bioestadística.Sujetos y métodos:Estudio observacional, transversal y analítico en estudiantes de primer curso de Grado en Medicina en la Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud y del Deporte de Huesca (Universidad de Zaragoza). Para la medición de la ansiedad hacia la estadística se utilizó la versión en castellano de la Statistical Anxiety Scale (SAS). Resultados: Respondieron el 91,1% (n =41) de los estudiantes. La puntuación media de la SAS fue de 2,51 ± 0,61. Las puntuaciones en las subescalas indicaron que los estudiantes padecen ansiedad baja o moderada por pedir ayuda e interpretar los resultados estadísticos, y algo más elevada ante el examen de estadística. El estudio de la correlación mostró que aquellos estudiantes con menor nivel de ansiedad por pedir ayuda e interpretar los resultados estadísticos obtuvieron mayor puntuación en el examen de bioestadística.Conclusiones:Los estudiantes presentan una moderada ansiedad hacia la estadística, aunque se necesita más investigación centrada en los cambios en la metodología de enseñanza, desde el comienzo del Grado en Medicina, para disminuir dicha ansiedad.Palabras clave Estadística; Estudiantes de medicina; Grado; Medición de la ansiedad; Metodología docente",

      "abstractNote": "The credibility of scientific claims depends upon the transparency of the research products upon which they are based (e.g., study protocols, data, materials, and analysis scripts). As psychology navigates a period of unprecedented introspection, user-friendly tools and services that support open science have flourished. However, the plethora of decisions and choices involved can be bewildering. Here we provide a practical guide to help researchers navigate the process of preparing and sharing the products of their research (e.g., choosing a repository, preparing their research products for sharing, structuring folders, etc.). Being an open scientist means adopting a few straightforward research management practices, which lead to less error prone, reproducible research workflows. Further, this adoption can be piecemeal – each incremental step towards complete transparency adds positive value. Transparent research practices not only improve the efficiency of individual researchers, they enhance the credibility of the knowledge generated by the scientific community.",

      "abstractNote": "Numerous researchers have discussed the potentially detrimental role that anxiety can play in thwarting positive student outcomes in higher education. Statistics anxiety, in particular, has been shown to pose a threat to statistics achievement. Although some previous researchers have demonstrated that statistics anxiety was directly related to impaired statistics performance, other researchers failed to identify such a relationship. Building from these inconsistencies in the literature, the present exploratory study used path analysis to investigate whether anxiety directly or indirectly impairs performance and its relationship with self-efficacy. In this study, we replicated previous findings that self-efficacy can predict a significant amount of the variability in statistics performance (β = .45, p = .001, adjusted R2 = .21), even after controlling for students’ prior GPAs. More importantly, through this study, we also demonstrated that anxiety did not directly impact performance (β = .23, p = .102), but instead altered students’ levels of self-efficacy (β = -.65, p = .001), and indirectly affected academic outcomes (β = -.30, p = .001). The results of this study provide evidence that students have the ability to gain the skills they need to succeed, even if they have a challenging academic history or heightened levels of anxiety. These results align with much of the previous literature, suggesting that classroom interventions at the undergraduate level should center less on decreasing student anxiety and more on instilling in students a sense of self-efficacy: the belief that, with effort and persistence, they can succeed in their statistics courses.",

Fostering statistical self-efficacy and positive attitudes about statistics is associated with course performance in psychology. We hypothesized that students enrolled in an advanced undergraduate statistics course would have higher self-efficacy for and more positive attitudes about statistical concepts and conducting analyses compared with students in the introductory statistics course. We assessed 49 introductory and 67 advanced statistics students attending a historically Black college for women at the beginning and end of the semester. Results suggest that self-efficacy increased across the semester for all students, with advanced statistics students having higher self-efficacy at the beginning of the semester than introductory students as measured by the 6-point Current Statistics Self-efficacy scale (mean difference = 0.96, CI [0.54–1.38], t = −4.52, p",

      "abstractNote": "it is important to investigate the relationship between disordered eating in male adolescents and smoking and alcohol consumption as they are risk factors to other diseases as well. For example, high levels of alcohol accompanied by the acidic damage and nutritional deficit exhibited in people with disordered eating habits - due to induced vomiting - has been shown to increase risk of esophageal cancer. Considering the very few studies done on disordered eating prevailing in males and the prevalence of smoking and drinking habits, our study aims to investigate the correlation between inappropriate eating habits and one’s dependence on cigarettes, waterpipes, and alcohol all the while focusing on male adolescents.",

      "abstractNote": "Are adjunct faculty a valued and necessary teaching resource at institutions of higher education, or are they really just a source of cheap labor? Both viewpoints, along with many in between, can be found in the literature regarding the use of adjunct faculty or part-time instructors in today’s colleges and universities. What is also evident in the literature is the sense that “those faculty members are critical to the financial and programmatic viability of their institutions” (Ellison, 2002, p.3). It appears that colleges and universities would not be able to remain open without adjunct faculty; part-time instructors now constitute approximately 50% of the total professoriate in this country (Jacoby, 2006; Schneider, 1999). Yet it seems that many adjuncts still do not receive the respect they deserve or the support they need to do their jobs properly, from either their full-time colleagues or the administration. Could they be considered the last marginalized group on American campuses? It is an issue that needs to be addressed in order to maintain the integrity of the American postsecondary institution and quality education for all students.",

      "abstractNote": "Most studies of eating disorders (ED) among adolescents have relied on the use of self-report questionnaires given its cost-effectiveness compared to interviews approaches. The Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) is one of the most commonly used self-report measures of eating psychopathology, despite issues regarding the underlying latent structure and its validity in this population. Given the lack of validated measures among Hispanic clinical samples, the current study aimed to validate previously suggested models for the adolescent version (EDE-Q-A) among female teenage patients with ED in Spain (Mage=15.45, SD=1.59). Results from confirmatory factor analyses failed to replicate the theoretical 4-factor structure, and a 2-factor model previously validated in a Hispanic-American community sample showed best fit over a 3-factor and a single-factor models. Excellent levels of internal consistency were observed for the two dimensions of the retained model and for the Global Score of the EDE-Q-A. Significant correlations with well established measures of ED (Eating Disorders Inventory; EDI-2) and self-esteem are presented as evidence for convergent and concurrent validity. Sensitivity analyses showed a similar patter of association between the retained model of the EDE-Q-A and the EDI-2. Current findings may contribute to development of evidence-based knowledge on ED among Hispanic clinical populations.",

      "abstractNote": "Families facing mental health challenges have very limited access to ongoing support. A formative evaluation of Families Healing Together (FHT), a new online family mental health recovery program was conducted using five waves (N=108) of data. Exploratory factor analysis of the measures identified as important to the program theory found strong reliability evidence (α=.77–.86) for 6 constructs. A poor response rate (25%) did not allow for valid pre and postoutcome evaluation, however we did have enough information to assess the psychometric properties of the new measures. The new evaluation tool accounted for 34% of the variance in Capacity to Support Family Member, and nearly 50% of the variance in Hopefulness toward Recovery. New programs without existing measures require formative evaluation strategies that accurately describe program activities in order to develop outcome measures sensitive to novel aspects of program components. Most outcome measures are developed for individuals with mental health challenges not family members. These new measures may be beneficial to effectively evaluate programs that promote family recovery and wellness.",

      "abstractNote": "Adequate statistical power contributes to observing true relationships in a dataset. With a thoughtful power analysis, the adequate but not excessive sample could be detected. Therefore, this paper reviews the issue of what sample size and sample power the researcher should have in the EFA, CFA, and SEM study. Statistical power is the estimation of the sample size that is appropriate for an analysis. In any study, four parameters related to power analysis are Alpha, Beta, statistical power and Effect size. They are prerequisites for a priori sample size determination. Scale development in general and Factor Analysis (EFA, CFA) and SEM are large sample size methods because sample affects precision and replicability of the results. However, the existing literature provides limited and sometimes conflicting guidance on this issue. Generally, for EFA the stronger the data, the smaller the sample can be for an accurate analysis. In CFA and SEM parameter estimates, chi-square tests and goodness of fit indices are equally sensitive to sample size. So the statistical power and precision of CFA/SEM parameter estimates are also influenced by sample size. In this work after reviewing existing sample power analysis rules along with more elaborated methods (like Monte Carlo simulation), we conclude with suggestions for small samples in factor analysis found in literature.",

      "abstractNote": "Multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) is an effective tool to handle missing data - an almost unavoidable problem in quantitative data analysis. However, despite the empirical and theoretical evidence supporting the use of MICE, researchers in the social sciences often resort to inferior approaches unnecessarily risking erroneous results. The complexity of the decision process when encountering missing data may be what is discouraging potential users from adopting the appropriate technique. In this article, we develop straightforward step-by-step graphical guidelines on how to handle missing data based on a comprehensive literature review. It is our hope that these guidelines can help improve current standards of handling missing data. The guidelines incorporate recent innovations on how to handle missing data such as random forests and predictive mean matching. Thus, the data analysts who already actively apply MICE may use it to review some of the newest developments. We demonstrate how the guidelines can be used in praxis using the statistical program R and data from the European Social Survey. We demonstrate central decisions such as variable selection and number of imputations as well as how to handle typical challenges such as skewed distributions and data transformations. These guidelines will enable a social science researcher to go through the process of handling missing data while adhering to the newest developments in the field.",

      "abstractNote": "Adjunct faculty members have become the dominant faculty demographic in American higher education, as the majority of all new faculty appointments are now part-time. Despite this, there remains a lack of comprehensive data regarding the adjunct experience, particularly in regards to specific subgroups of adjunct faculty. While some adjuncts function as replacements for fulltime faculty, adjunct practitioners have a unique value-add in that they bring professional knowledge and field experience into the classroom. For this reason, they play an integral role in practice-based programs. In order to become successful instructors, they must be supported by the administration and integrated into the academic community; however, much about the experience of this group is unknown. Therefore the purpose of this qualitative case study was to gain insight into the experience of adjunct practitioners. Using Kahn’s (1990) theory of employee engagement, this study sought to answer the following research question: How do adjunct practitioners experience engagement at a mid-sized private university on the West Coast? Data gathered from interviews and a document review produced four key findings: first, participants feel teaching is personally meaningful, though they lack a sense of community with other faculty and the institution as a whole. Second, participants do not feel entirely secure in their roles and are concerned about their future security with the institution. And third, participants believe they possess the necessary basic resources to perform their role, but would appreciate more accessible development opportunities. Implications for practice and recommendations for future research are also discussed.",

However, because the practice of pre-registration is relatively new to psychological science, specific guidelines for the content of registrations are still in a formative stage. After giving a brief history of preregistration in medical and psychological research, we outline two different models that can be applied—reviewed and unreviewed pre-registration—and discuss the advantages of each model to science as a whole and to the individual scientist, as well as some of their drawbacks and limitations. Finally, we present and justify a proposed standard template that can facilitate pre-registration. Researchers can use the template before and during the editorial process to meet article requirements and enhance the robustness of their scholarly efforts.",

      "abstractNote": "Ongoing need for adjunct instructor support is a critical aspect for institutions to consider. Through research focused on fulltime and part-time faculty job satisfaction, a number of practices for supporting faculty and improving job satisfaction have been suggested. In this article, we present an innovative model of instructor resources and supports within a mathematics department. We focus on how these various resources and supports have benefited our part-time adjunct faculty job satisfaction and describe how the supports and challenges experienced by our Precalculus adjunct faculty are related to variables impacting job satisfaction found in literature. We also present some additional factors that were missing in prior studies in literature but were found important for our adjunct instructors’ job satisfaction. Our findings can inform other institutions’ and mathematics departments’ efforts to support their own part-time faculty teaching introductory courses such as Precalculus.",

      "abstractNote": "Appreciation of the importance of statistics literacy for citizens of a democracy has resulted in an increasing number of degree programs making statistics courses mandatory for university students. Unfortunately, empirical evidence suggests that students in nonmathematical disciplines (e.g., social sciences) regard statistics courses as the most anxiety-inducing course in their degree programs. Although a literature review exists for statistics anxiety, it was done more than a decade ago, and newer studies have since added findings for consideration. In this article, we provide a current review of the statistics anxiety literature. Specifically, related variables, definitions, and measures of statistics anxiety are reviewed with the goal of refining the statistics anxiety construct. Antecedents, effects, and interventions of statistics anxiety are also reviewed to provide recommendations for statistics instructors and for a new research agenda.",

      "abstractNote": "Research frequently uses the quantitative approach to explore undergraduate students’ anxiety regarding statistics. However, few studies of adults’ statistics anxiety use the qualitative method, or a sole focus on graduate students. Moreover, even fewer studies focus on a comparison of adults’ anxiety levels before and after an introductory statistics course. This line of study is important to pursue, since the introductory statistics course should play very important roles of both preparing students’ foundation knowledge and inspiring their interests for a higher-level course. In addition, graduate students tend to have different backgrounds, learning motivations, and learning habits, compared to their undergraduate counterparts. Overall, limited mixed research method is available on social sciences graduate students’ (1) statistics anxiety before and after the introductory statistics course, and (2) actions taken to decrease the anxiety. This study seeks to fill this gap by incorporating a mixed research method in order to explore social sciences graduate students’ statistics learning processes. Findings suggest that the social sciences graduate students’ anxiety levels tend to diminish after the introductory statistics course, even though these also experience severe statistics anxiety at the very beginning. These findings become essential for institutions, higher education instructors, and social sciences statistics learners to consider.",

      "abstractNote": "We examined motivational orientations, cognitive–metacognitive strategies, and resource management in predicting academic achievement. Undergraduates (407) completed the Motivated Strategies Learning Questionnaire, Implicit Theories of Intelligence Scale, Achievement Goal Inventory, and self-reported grade point average. A MANCOVA (controlling for sex and age) indicated that low self-efficacy students tended to believe intelligence is innate and unchangeable and high self-efficacy students pursued mastery goals involving challenge and gaining new knowledge as well as performance goals involving good grades and outperforming others. Further, hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated that self-efficacy, effort regulation, and help-seeking predicted 18% of the variance in GPA. Interestingly, effort regulation partially mediated the relationship between self-efficacy and GPA. Overall, self-efficacious students are able to achieve academically because they monitor and self-regulate their impulses and persist in the face of difficulties. We discuss implications of these findings for educators seeking to strengthen both self-efficacy and effort regulation towards increasing academic achievement.",

As psychology navigates a period of unprecedented introspection, user-friendly tools and services that support open science have flourished. However, the plethora of decisions and choices involved can be bewildering. Here we provide a practical guide to help researchers navigate the process of preparing and sharing the products of their research (e.g., choosing a repository, preparing their research products for sharing, structuring folders, etc.). Being an open scientist means adopting a few straightforward research management practices, which lead to less error prone, reproducible research workflows. Further, this adoption can be piecemeal – each incremental step towards complete transparency adds positive value. Transparent research practices not only improve the efficiency of individual researchers, they enhance the credibility of the knowledge generated by the scientific community.",

These barriers affected the ability of part-time faculty to optimally perform their duties, depending on their individual situation. The barriers were for the most part institutional and structural and needed to be addressed at the institutional level.",

      "abstractNote": "Fatigue in air ambulance crews leads to decrements in performance and situational awareness that may contribute to aircraft accidents and patient care mistakes. Fatigue assessments completed by flight crews can give early warning when fatigue is accumulating. Countermeasures can then be implemented to improve performance and increase safety. No validated air ambulance fatigue assessment currently exists that incorporates transport-specific factors. The objective of this study was to validate a flight fatigue assessment that accounts for air transport–specific factors. Flight crewmembers from multiple air ambulance programs participated and completed assessments. Results were analyzed to determine if the assessment captured or predicted fatigue levels of crewmembers. When used to measure crewmember fatigue, the assessment was shown to consistently and reliably confirm accumulating fatigue and correlated with crew-reported levels of fatigue. A predicted fatigue scale was created to help crewmembers objectively identify their fatigue level. Used consistently, the transport fatigue assessment should increase awareness of accumulating fatigue. With awareness, crewmembers are better equipped to justify and take advantage of opportunities to mitigate their fatigue, increase crew coordination, enhance safety, and improve patient care.",

EFA and CFA are widely used in measurement applications for construct validation and scale refinement. One of the more critical aspects of any CFA or EFA is communicating results. This work described reporting essentials of EFA with goodness of fit indices and CFA research when they are used to validate a measurement instrument with continuous variables in a different population from the one originally created. An overview of the minimum information to be reported is included along with short extracts from real published reports. For each reported section basic information to be included is described along with an example-extract adapted from published factor analysis construct validation studies. Additional issues covered include: Cross-validation, Measurement Invariance across Age and Gender, Reliability (α and ω), AVE-Based Validity, Convergent and Discriminant Validity with Correlation Analysis and Normative Data. Properly reported EFA and CFA could contribute to the improvement of the quality of the measurement instruments. A summary of good practices in CFA and SEM reporting based on literature is also included.",

Method: Conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory structural equation models (ESEM) were tested using three samples (Ntotal = 959). Results: In all samples, a CFA model specifying satisfaction and frustration of each psychological need as distinguishable constructs ﬁt the data better than models specifying them as part of a continuum, even after including method corrections (CFA) or cross-loadings (ESEM). Scale score reliabilities were adequate only when the satisfaction and frustration of each need were treated as distinguishable constructs. Conclusions: The paper provides strong support for specifying need satisfaction and frustration as distinguishable but correlated constructs, as well as adequate evidence of dimensionality, reliability and criterion validity for the Spanish version of the NSFS.",

      "abstractNote": "The uses and methodology of factor analysis are widely debated and discussed, especially the issues of rotational use, methods of confirmatory factor analysis, and adequate sample size. The variety of perspectives and often conflicting opinions can lead to confusion among researchers about best practices for using factor analysis. The focus of the present review is to clarify terminology, identify key issues, and clarify areas of debate regarding best practices and functions of factor analytic procedures., The conclusions and implications drawn should be useful to researchers in education, psychology, and cognate social fields who employ factor analytic procedures or evaluate research using factor analytic methods.

      "abstractNote": "Ongoing need for adjunct instructor support is a critical aspect for institutions to consider. Through research focused on fulltime and part-time faculty job satisfaction, a number of practices for supporting faculty and improving job satisfaction have been suggested. In this article, we present an innovative model of instructor resources and supports within a mathematics department. We focus on how these various resources and supports have benefited our part-time adjunct faculty job satisfaction and describe how the supports and challenges experienced by our Precalculus adjunct faculty are related to variables impacting job satisfaction found in literature. We also present some additional factors that were missing in prior studies in literature but were found important for our adjunct instructors’ job satisfaction. Our findings can inform other institutions’ and mathematics departments’ efforts to support their own part-time faculty teaching introductory courses such as Precalculus.",

      "abstractNote": "The Hare Psychopathy Checklist – Revised (PCL-R) is among the most well-established instruments for the assessment of psychopathy. The PCL-R is a 20-item observer rating instrument based on file review and a semi-structured interview. The current study aimed to investigate the validity of the German adaptation of the PCL-R, its factor structure, construct validity, and association with socially desirable responding in a sample of male offenders (N = 118). A parcel model with four facets and two factors yielded excellent model fit. Convergent and discriminant validity were assessed based on correlational analyses, a multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) matrix, and a canonical correlation analysis (CCA) including measures of psychopathy, antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), global personality dimensions, alexithymia, and impulsivity. The MTMM matrix as well as substantial associations with self-reported psychopathic traits and observer ratings of ASPD indicated convergent validity. Correlational analyses revealed that Factor 1 of the PCL-R was associated with low neuroticism, whereas Factor 2 was associated with impulsivity as well as with low agreeableness and conscientiousness. The PCL-R total score and Factor 2 were negatively correlated with impression management. Overall, the current findings support the validity of the German adaptation of the PCL-R.

The adoption of the new guidelines will greatly advance students’ statistical literacy: the ability to read and interpret statistics relevant to consumers and decision makers.",

      "abstractNote": "Statistics education is an important component of the undergraduate psychology major. However, undergraduates taking advanced statistics courses are understudied. Fostering statistical self-efficacy and positive attitudes about statistics is associated with course performance in psychology. We hypothesized that students enrolled in an advanced undergraduate statistics course would have higher self-efficacy for and more positive attitudes about statistical concepts and conducting analyses compared with students in the introductory statistics course. We assessed 49 introductory and 67 advanced statistics students attending a historically Black college for women at the beginning and end of the semester. Results suggest that self-efficacy increased across the semester for all students, with advanced statistics students having higher self-efficacy at the beginning of the semester than introductory students as measured by the 6-point Current Statistics Self-efficacy scale (mean difference = 0.96, CI [0.54–1.38], t = −4.52, p",

      "abstractNote": "The (latest) crisis in conﬁdence in social psychology has generated much heated discussion about the importance of replication, including how it should be carried out as well as interpreted by scholars in the ﬁeld. For example, what does it mean if a replication attempt “fails”—does it mean that the original results, or the theory that predicted them, have been falsiﬁed? And how should “failed” replications affect our belief in the validity of the original research? In this paper, we consider the replication debate from a historical and philosophical perspective, and provide a conceptual analysis of both replication and falsiﬁcation as they pertain to this important discussion. Along the way, we highlight the importance of auxiliary assumptions (for both testing theories and attempting replications), and introduce a Bayesian framework for assessing “failed” replications in terms of how they should affect our conﬁdence in original ﬁndings.",

      "abstractNote": "Adequate statistical power contributes to observing true relationships in a dataset. With a thoughtful power analysis, the adequate but not excessive sample could be detected. Therefore, this paper reviews the issue of what sample size and sample power the researcher should have in the EFA, CFA, and SEM study. Statistical power is the estimation of the sample size that is appropriate for an analysis. In any study, four parameters related to power analysis are Alpha, Beta, statistical power and Effect size. They are prerequisites for a priori sample size determination. Scale development in general and Factor Analysis (EFA, CFA) and SEM are large sample size methods because sample affects precision and replicability of the results. However, the existing literature provides limited and sometimes conflicting guidance on this issue. Generally, for EFA the stronger the data, the smaller the sample can be for an accurate analysis. In CFA and SEM parameter estimates, chi-square tests and goodness of fit indices are equally sensitive to sample size. So the statistical power and precision of CFA/SEM parameter estimates are also influenced by sample size. In this work after reviewing existing sample power analysis rules along with more elaborated methods (like Monte Carlo simulation), we conclude with suggestions for small samples in factor analysis found in literature.",

Fatigue assessments completed by flight crews can give early warning when fatigue is accumulating. Countermeasures can then be implemented to improve performance and increase safety. No validated air ambulance fatigue assessment currently exists that incorporates transport-specific factors. The objective of this study was to validate a flight fatigue assessment that accounts for air transport–specific factors. Flight crewmembers from multiple air ambulance programs participated and completed assessments. Results were analyzed to determine if the assessment captured or predicted fatigue levels of crewmembers. When used to measure crewmember fatigue, the assessment was shown to consistently and reliably confirm accumulating fatigue and correlated with crew-reported levels of fatigue. A predicted fatigue scale was created to help crewmembers objectively identify their fatigue level. Used consistently, the transport fatigue assessment should increase awareness of accumulating fatigue. With awareness, crewmembers are better equipped to justify and take advantage of opportunities to mitigate their fatigue, increase crew coordination, enhance safety, and improve patient care.",

The sample consisted of 1318 students enrolled in Intermediate Algebra classes at a community college. Multivariate analyses revealed that faculty employment status (full time or part time) was not associated with students' final grades or completion rates. Faculty education level was correlated with coursefinal grades, with faculty possessing graduate degrees having better student outcomes. Student gender, race, and age were associated with outcomes; semester hours attempted were not. These findings should help equip administrators to make informed decisions regardingfaculty assignments that lead to improved student outcomes and help faculty to target interventions for \"at-risk\" students.",

      "abstractNote": "We developed measures of current statistics self-efficacy (CSSE) and self-efficacy to learn statistics (SELS) to address whether statistics self-efficacy is related to statistics performance, and whether self-efficacy for statistics increases during an introductory statistics course. Both instruments yielded reliable, one-factor solutions that were related positively to each other and to two measures of statistics performance (i.e., specific statistics problems and overall course performance). The CSSE and SELS also were related positively to math self-efficacy and attitudes towards statistics, but related negatively to anxiety. Changes between two different testing occasions using the CSSE indicated that statistics self-efficacy increased almost two standard deviations over a 12-week instructional period.",

The investigation was done in the context of how male academics construct their world in a university during transformation. A group of white, male academics in the human sciences were provided with a camera and were requested to take pictures of the most mean-ingful aspects of their work environment. Thereafter photo-elicitation interviews were conducted, transcribed and analysed. The study illustrates the usefulness of reflexive photography to determine human interpretation of interaction with the environment. Participants commented positively on and helped to identify the advantages and limitations of the technique. The research indicated that photographs have no intrinsic meaning but serve as symbols of meaning that participants explain during interviews. Content analysis, a second level of analysis that is based on the first level, is useful in some ways as indicated.",

      "abstractNote": "The reform movement in statistics education has led to a revitalization of the undergraduate introductory statistics course. However, many students satisfy their degree requirements by taking statistics courses in “client departments” such as business, the social sciences, and the lab sciences, typically taught by nonstatisticians. This article presents the findings of a metasynthesis of the existing literature on teaching statistics in these client disciplines to learn (1) what is currently being taught and how, and (2) the most important challenges for statistics teachers in other departments. Articles were reviewed using qualitative axial coding and quantitative text analysis to identify common research themes and ideas in the literature for each discipline. Research themes, attitudes toward statistics instruction, and pedagogical techniques were found to vary from discipline to discipline. Collaboration with instructors in other disciplines may be a welcome step toward improving statistics instruction across the university.",

      "abstractNote": "Introduction\nPain management is a complex process that is managed through a multi-disciplinary team in which nurses have a significant role. The present study aimed at translating and examining the psychometric properties of the Pain Management Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PMSEQ) among Iranian nurses.\n\nMethods\nThis was a cross-sectional, methodological study conducted in 2019 among nurses working in two teaching hospitals in Sanandaj (Tohid and Kosar). The participants were selected using a convenience sampling method. Responsiveness; interpretability; and face, content, and construct validities were examined using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. In addition, internal consistency and stability were examined using the Cronbach’s alpha and test-retest, respectively.\n\nResults\nOverall, 410 nurses (210 for the EFA and 200 for the CFA) were included in the sample. In the exploratory factor analysis, two factors of comprehensive pain assessment and pain management with eigenvalues of 6.36 and 1.91, respectively, were extracted. The two factors together explained 56.64% of the variance of nurses’ pain management self-efficacy. The confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the model had a moderate fit to the data (RMSEA: 0.12; NFI: 0.84; NNFI: 0.86; CFI: 0.88; IFI: 0.88; RFI: 0.81; GFI: 0.76; AGFI: 0.69; PGFI: 0.59; RMR: 0.09; standardized RMR: 0.09). Total questionnaire and the two factors (i.e. comprehensive pain assessment and pain management) had internal consistency coefficients of 0.891, 0.876, and 0.803, respectively.\n\nConclusion\nThe Farsi version of PMSEQ had good internal consistency and reliability, as well as content and construct validity, and can be used in future studies.",

      "abstractNote": "Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) is a powerful and commonly-used tool for investigating the underlying variable structure of a psychometric instrument. However, there is much controversy in the social sciences with regard to the techniques used in EFA (Ford, MacCallum, & Tait, 1986; Henson & Roberts, 2006) and the reliability of the outcome. Simulations by Costello and Osborne (2005), for example, demonstrate how poorly some EFA analyses replicate, even with clear underlying factor structures and large samples. Thus, we argue that researchers should routinely examine the stability or volatility of their EFA solutions to gain more insight into the robustness of their solutions and insight into how to improve their instruments while still at the exploratory stage of development.

      "abstractNote": "it is important to investigate the relationship between disordered eating in male adolescents and smoking and alcohol consumption as they are risk factors to other diseases as well. For example, high levels of alcohol accompanied by the acidic damage and nutritional deficit exhibited in people with disordered eating habits - due to induced vomiting - has been shown to increase risk of esophageal cancer. Considering the very few studies done on disordered eating prevailing in males and the prevalence of smoking and drinking habits, our study aims to investigate the correlation between inappropriate eating habits and one’s dependence on cigarettes, waterpipes, and alcohol all the while focusing on male adolescents.",

However, identifying the main features of theme as the data analysis product and the method of its development remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to describe the meaning of theme and offer a method on theme construction that can be used by qualitative content analysis and thematic analysis researchers in line with the underpinning speciﬁc approach to data analysis. This methodological paper comprises an analytical overview of qualitative descriptive research products and the meaning of theme. Also, our practical experiences of qualitative analysis supported by relevant published literature informed the generation of a stage like model of theme construction for qualitative content analysis and thematic analysis. This paper comprises: (i) analytical importance of theme, (ii) meaning of theme, (iii) meaning of category, (iv) theme and category in terms of level of content, and (v) theme development. This paper offers a conceptual clariﬁcation and a pragmatic step by step method of theme development that has the capacity of assisting nurse researchers understand how theme is developed. As nursing is a pragmatic discipline, nurse researchers have tried to develop practical ﬁndings and devise some way to “do something” with ﬁndings to enhance the action and impact of nursing. The application of a precise method of theme development for qualitative descriptive data analysis suggested in this paper helps yield meaningful, credible and practical results for nursing.",

It is not sufficient to account only for teachers’ cognition and affect in regard to the subject matter of statistics. We also need to understand the personal characteristics teachers have related to developing the statisticsrelated cognitive and affective traits of students. Toward this end, researchers have supplemented studies of teachers’ subject matter knowledge with studies of their pedagogical content knowledge, technological pedagogical statistical knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes relevant to teaching statistics. We describe existing models and empirical research concerning each of these characteristics. Written assessments, interview techniques, and observation methods for assessing teachers’ development of the characteristics are described as well. Strengths and limitations of existing models and assessments are discussed. We conclude by summarizing statistics teacher education research in the specific areas of data, uncertainty, and statistical inference. We close with recommendations about how statistics teachers’ cognitive and affective characteristics may be developed by learning from teaching practice, immersion in statistical content, and use of technological environments. Opportunities and directions for future research appear throughout the chapter. Some specific research needs include progressive development of improved models for statistics teachers’ cognition and affect along with robust qualitative and quantitative assessment tools.",

      "abstractNote": "The Emotions as a Child Scale (EAC) is an efficient tool to assess parental emotion socialization in Western contexts. However, the cross-cultural utility of the EAC has not been well documented. To address this gap, the present study aimed to investigate its factor structure and measurement invariance across child sex in Chinese children (n = 477, 47.4% girls, 9- to 12-years-old). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses suggested that a revised 2-factor model (including 12 items in each of the three emotion subscales), consisting of supportive and nonsupportive strategies, was a good alternative to prior models. This new 2-factor model demonstrated strict measurement invariance across child sex and satisfactory internal consistency. The criterion validity of the revised EAC was supported by expected relationships with the measures of child–parent relationship and parenting behavior. Findings suggest that the revised EAC holds promise as a youth-reported instrument for assessing perceived parental emotion socialization in Chinese children, although more studies are needed to replicate our findings in other Chinese samples.

      "abstractNote": "Background: This paper aims to (1) investigate whether psychological need satisfaction and frustration are distinguishable constructs or part of a single continuum, and (2) to develop and validate the Spanish version of the Need Satisfaction and Frustration Scale (NSFS). Method: Conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory structural equation models (ESEM) were tested using three samples (Ntotal = 959). Results: In all samples, a CFA model specifying satisfaction and frustration of each psychological need as distinguishable constructs ﬁt the data better than models specifying them as part of a continuum, even after including method corrections (CFA) or cross-loadings (ESEM). Scale score reliabilities were adequate only when the satisfaction and frustration of each need were treated as distinguishable constructs. Conclusions: The paper provides strong support for specifying need satisfaction and frustration as distinguishable but correlated constructs, as well as adequate evidence of dimensionality, reliability and criterion validity for the Spanish version of the NSFS.",

      "abstractNote": "Adequate statistical power contributes to observing true relationships in a dataset. With a thoughtful power analysis, the adequate but not excessive sample could be detected. Therefore, this paper reviews the issue of what sample size and sample power the researcher should have in the EFA, CFA, and SEM study. Statistical power is the estimation of the sample size that is appropriate for an analysis. In any study, four parameters related to power analysis are Alpha, Beta, statistical power and Effect size. They are prerequisites for a priori sample size determination. Scale development in general and Factor Analysis (EFA, CFA) and SEM are large sample size methods because sample affects precision and replicability of the results. However, the existing literature provides limited and sometimes conflicting guidance on this issue. Generally, for EFA the stronger the data, the smaller the sample can be for an accurate analysis. In CFA and SEM parameter estimates, chi-square tests and goodness of fit indices are equally sensitive to sample size. So the statistical power and precision of CFA/SEM parameter estimates are also influenced by sample size. In this work after reviewing existing sample power analysis rules along with more elaborated methods (like Monte Carlo simulation), we conclude with suggestions for small samples in factor analysis found in literature.",

      "abstractNote": "More than 60% of the nation’s 14 million community college students are required to complete at least one developmental mathematics class before enrolling in college-credit courses; however, 80% of them do not successfully complete any collegelevel mathematics course within 3 years. To address this problem, the Community College Pathways initiative was launched in 2009. A core element is the Pathways Faculty Support Program, professional development aimed at supporting faculty to develop knowledge, beliefs, skills, and practices for teaching Pathways courses. In fall 2014, a redesign of the program used improvement science methods to design an infrastructure for responsive, flexible professional development that is sensitive to varying and changing conditions, with mechanisms for identifying, designing, and testing ideas for improvement. Specifically, our team employed a user-centered design process that foregrounds the needs and work processes of Pathways faculty and a measurement system that drives the continuous improvement of the program.",

      "abstractNote": "Psychology has recently been viewed as facing a replication crisis because efforts to replicate past study ﬁndings frequently do not show the same result. Often, the ﬁrst study showed a statistically signiﬁcant result but the replication does not. Questions then arise about whether the ﬁrst study results were false positives, and whether the replication study correctly indicates that there is truly no effect after all. This article suggests these so-called failures to replicate may not be failures at all, but rather are the result of low statistical power in single replication studies, and the result of failure to appreciate the need for multiple replications in order to have enough power to identify true effects. We provide examples of these power problems and suggest some solutions using Bayesian statistics and metaanalysis. Although the need for multiple replication studies may frustrate those who would prefer quick answers to psychology’s alleged crisis, the large sample sizes typically needed to provide ﬁrm evidence will almost always require concerted efforts from multiple investigators. As a result, it remains to be seen how many of the recently claimed failures to replicate will be supported or instead may turn out to be artifacts of inadequate sample sizes and single study replications.",

      "abstractNote": "The propensity score is the probability of treatment assignment conditional on observed baseline characteristics. The propensity score allows one to design and analyze an observational (nonrandomized) study so that it mimics some of the particular characteristics of a randomized controlled trial. In particular, the propensity score is a balancing score: conditional on the propensity score, the distribution of observed baseline covariates will be similar between treated and untreated subjects. I describe 4 different propensity score methods: matching on the propensity score, stratification on the propensity score, inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score, and covariate adjustment using the propensity score. I describe balance diagnostics for examining whether the propensity score model has been adequately specified. Furthermore, I discuss differences between regression-based methods and propensity score-based methods for the analysis of observational data. I describe different causal average treatment effects and their relationship with propensity score analyses.",

Para un mayor desempeño en el aprendizaje de esta materia pensando en los futuros médicos, es crucial el análisis de la ansiedad experimentada por el estudiante de medicina durante la formación en esta materia en el grado.Objetivos:Documentar la ansiedad hacia la estadística experimentada por los estudiantes de Grado en Medicina y evaluar su relación con el desempeño en la materia de bioestadística.Sujetos y métodos:Estudio observacional, transversal y analítico en estudiantes de primer curso de Grado en Medicina en la Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud y del Deporte de Huesca (Universidad de Zaragoza). Para la medición de la ansiedad hacia la estadística se utilizó la versión en castellano de la Statistical Anxiety Scale (SAS). Resultados: Respondieron el 91,1% (n =41) de los estudiantes. La puntuación media de la SAS fue de 2,51 ± 0,61. Las puntuaciones en las subescalas indicaron que los estudiantes padecen ansiedad baja o moderada por pedir ayuda e interpretar los resultados estadísticos, y algo más elevada ante el examen de estadística. El estudio de la correlación mostró que aquellos estudiantes con menor nivel de ansiedad por pedir ayuda e interpretar los resultados estadísticos obtuvieron mayor puntuación en el examen de bioestadística.Conclusiones:Los estudiantes presentan una moderada ansiedad hacia la estadística, aunque se necesita más investigación centrada en los cambios en la metodología de enseñanza, desde el comienzo del Grado en Medicina, para disminuir dicha ansiedad.Palabras clave Estadística; Estudiantes de medicina; Grado; Medición de la ansiedad; Metodología docente",

      "abstractNote": "Background: About 70% of teachers who instruct healthcare students are considered sessional (adjunct/temporary part-time) faculty and receive limited instruction in pedagogy. Sessional faculty may feel isolated and struggle with their teacher identity, and are often assumed to vary in their commitment, motivation, and ability to teach. However, research on teaching identity, motivations, and needs of sessional faculty is lacking. The aim of this study was to compare similarities and differences between sessional and tenure-track faculty across a health science school to guide faculty development for sessional faculty. Methods: We developed an online needs assessment survey, based on informal interviews and literature reviews. Seventy-eight tenure-track faculty and 160 sessional faculty completed the survey (37, 25% response rate, respectively). We used validated scales to assess intrinsic motivation, identified regulated motivation, and identification with teaching, as well as developed scales (perceived connectedness, motivated by appreciation to try new teaching method) and single items. All scales demonstrated good internal consistency. We compared sessional and tenure-track faculty using t-tests/chi-square values. Results: We found similarities between sessional and tenure-track faculty in intrinsic motivation, identified regulated motivation, and identification with teaching. However, sessional faculty perceived less department connectedness and were more motivated to improve instruction if shown appreciation for trying new teaching methods. Sessional faculty agreed more that they desired pedagogy instruction before starting to teach and that teachers should invest energy in improving their teaching. Admitting to less participation in activities to enhance teaching in the last year, sessional faculty were more interested in digital formats of faculty development. Conclusion: Our comparison suggested that sessional faculty value being a teacher as part of their self, similar to tenured faculty, but desired more appreciation for efforts to improve and perceived less connectedness to their university department than tenured faculty. They also preferred digital formats for pedagogy to improve accessibility, prior to and throughout their teaching career to support their development as teachers. Using this information as a guide, we provide suggestions for faculty development for sessional faculty. Supporting sessional faculty in the health sciences should improve the quality of teaching and positively affect student learning.",

      "abstractNote": "Statistical analysis is error prone. A best practice for researchers using statistics would therefore be to share data among co-authors, allowing double-checking of executed tasks just as co-pilots do in aviation. To document the extent to which this ‘co-piloting’ currently occurs in psychology, we surveyed the authors of 697 articles published in six top psychology journals and asked them whether they had collaborated on four aspects of analyzing data and reporting results, and whether the described data had been shared between the authors. We acquired responses for 49.6% of the articles and found that co-piloting on statistical analysis and reporting results is quite uncommon among psychologists, while data sharing among co-authors seems reasonably but not completely standard. We then used an automated procedure to study the prevalence of statistical reporting errors in the articles in our sample and examined the relationship between reporting errors and co-piloting. Overall, 63% of the articles contained at least one p-value that was inconsistent with the reported test statistic and the accompanying degrees of freedom, and 20% of the articles contained at least one p-value that was inconsistent to such a degree that it may have affected decisions about statistical significance. Overall, the probability that a given p-value was inconsistent was over 10%. Co-piloting was not found to be associated with reporting errors.",

Therefore, this paper reviews the issue of what sample size and sample power the researcher should have in the EFA, CFA, and SEM study. Statistical power is the estimation of the sample size that is appropriate for an analysis. In any study, four parameters related to power analysis are Alpha, Beta, statistical power and Effect size. They are prerequisites for a priori sample size determination. Scale development in general and Factor Analysis (EFA, CFA) and SEM are large sample size methods because sample affects precision and replicability of the results. However, the existing literature provides limited and sometimes conflicting guidance on this issue. Generally, for EFA the stronger the data, the smaller the sample can be for an accurate analysis. In CFA and SEM parameter estimates, chi-square tests and goodness of fit indices are equally sensitive to sample size. So the statistical power and precision of CFA/SEM parameter estimates are also influenced by sample size. In this work after reviewing existing sample power analysis rules along with more elaborated methods (like Monte Carlo simulation), we conclude with suggestions for small samples in factor analysis found in literature.",

The SATS was administered to Italian-speaking undergraduate students enrolled in introductory statistics courses. A conﬁrmatory factor analysis validated the four-factor structure of the scale, and good indices for both reliability and validity were obtained. A multi-group analysis conﬁrmed the time invariance (beginning vs. end of the course) of the SATS, with a minor exception. Given the invariance across time, latent mean structures analysis revealed small to large signiﬁcant changes in the four attitude dimensions. The present study provided evidence for the validity and reliability of the SATS when applied to the Italian learning framework.",

Adult Learning Theory provided the theoretical framework for the study. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted with seven adjuncts from the College of Arts and Sciences at a private, four‐year university in New England. The transcripts were analyzed using interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) and four major findings emerged from the analytic process: (a) the participants demonstrated a limited understanding of the principles of learner‐centered pedagogy; (b) the participants demonstrated a limited use of learner‐centered instructional practices; (c) institutional factors impacted their capacity to learn and apply learner‐centered teaching; and (d) the participants were characterized by adjunct types that reflected the unique needs and interests of each cohort relative to teaching and learning. These findings were examined within the context of the framework of Adult Learning Theory and situated within the extant literature. They suggest opportunities for enhancing adjuncts’ understanding and application of learner‐centered pedagogy to enhance their teaching effectiveness and to improve student learning outcomes.",

It is not sufficient to account only for teachers’ cognition and affect in regard to the subject matter of statistics. We also need to understand the personal characteristics teachers have related to developing the statisticsrelated cognitive and affective traits of students. Toward this end, researchers have supplemented studies of teachers’ subject matter knowledge with studies of their pedagogical content knowledge, technological pedagogical statistical knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes relevant to teaching statistics. We describe existing models and empirical research concerning each of these characteristics. Written assessments, interview techniques, and observation methods for assessing teachers’ development of the characteristics are described as well. Strengths and limitations of existing models and assessments are discussed. We conclude by summarizing statistics teacher education research in the specific areas of data, uncertainty, and statistical inference. We close with recommendations about how statistics teachers’ cognitive and affective characteristics may be developed by learning from teaching practice, immersion in statistical content, and use of technological environments. Opportunities and directions for future research appear throughout the chapter. Some specific research needs include progressive development of improved models for statistics teachers’ cognition and affect along with robust qualitative and quantitative assessment tools.",

      "abstractNote": "In spite of the high failure rate of Latinx students in developmental courses taught at community colleges in the United States, little is known about how mathematical instruction contributes to this problem. Less is known about how adjunct instructors teach these courses or about their students’ accounts of their experiences. This dissertation investigated instruction in a developmental mathematics course taught by an adjunct faculty at a Hispanic-serving community college by (1) describing the student-instructor, student-student, instructor-content, and student-content interactions (Cohen, Raudenbush, & Ball, 2003); (2) documenting student perceptions of those interactions, their instructional experiences; and (3) analyzing the way in which these varied interactions and perceptions could be explained by the wealths students brought to the course (Yosso, 2005) and the systems in which students were situated (Bronfenbrenner, 1977; 1994). Three modes of instruction were enacted in the course, lecture (the most common), individual student work time, and student presentations. The instructor led the student-instructor interactions by checking, correcting, or validating students’ work. Student- student interactions occurred only when students compared answers. The instructor-content interactions revealed mathematics as a disjoint set of problems solved with prescribed sets of steps. The student-content interactions consisted of practicing work already demonstrated by the instructor. Students’ instructional experiences described a caring instructor who wanted them to succeed and hoped for more time to explore and practice problems and less time watching their instructor lecture, more interaction with peers, and more support to create a classroom community. The microsystems in which students were situated—school, work, and home—\nxiv\ninfluenced one another; various exosystems—instructor’s teaching experience, supports available from the mathematics department for adjunct faculty, adjunct instructor’s out of class obligations, and departmental course scheduling—had direct and indirect effects on instruction and on the students’ instructional experiences and mediated the ways that students and the instructor adapted to and interacted with each other during instruction. Students’ reported levels of aspirational, navigational, and social wealth interacted in ways that seem to influence their course outcomes: students with narrow aspirational wealth but broad navigational and social wealth knew how to find supports and balance the demands of the course whereas students with broader aspirational wealth and narrower navigational and social wealth thought that by attending the course and doing what was expected would result in positive outcomes. These demonstrations of cultural wealth aligned with the course outcomes: students in the first group who subverted the classroom cultural norms and pressed for changes passed; students in the second group who tended to align to and accept the classroom cultural norms failed. Thus, merely attending class and doing the work as instructors ask students to do may not be sufficient to pass a developmental class. The indirect influences of the exosystems require students to develop broader levels of social and navigational capital in order to be successful; this can be done by repeating college courses, an undesirable path or by providing explicit support to broaden students’ navigational and social wealth. Engaging students during instruction could support these efforts, making explicit the supports and resources necessary to succeed. Finally, mathematics departments might need to re-evaluate the content of developmental courses and provide more and varied opportunities for adjunct faculty to receive support while teaching these courses.",

      "abstractNote": "More than 60% of the nation’s 14 million community college students are required to complete at least one developmental mathematics class before enrolling in college-credit courses; however, 80% of them do not successfully complete any collegelevel mathematics course within 3 years. To address this problem, the Community College Pathways initiative was launched in 2009. A core element is the Pathways Faculty Support Program, professional development aimed at supporting faculty to develop knowledge, beliefs, skills, and practices for teaching Pathways courses. In fall 2014, a redesign of the program used improvement science methods to design an infrastructure for responsive, flexible professional development that is sensitive to varying and changing conditions, with mechanisms for identifying, designing, and testing ideas for improvement. Specifically, our team employed a user-centered design process that foregrounds the needs and work processes of Pathways faculty and a measurement system that drives the continuous improvement of the program.",

However, because the practice of pre-registration is relatively new to psychological science, specific guidelines for the content of registrations are still in a formative stage. After giving a brief history of preregistration in medical and psychological research, we outline two different models that can be applied—reviewed and unreviewed pre-registration—and discuss the advantages of each model to science as a whole and to the individual scientist, as well as some of their drawbacks and limitations. Finally, we present and justify a proposed standard template that can facilitate pre-registration. Researchers can use the template before and during the editorial process to meet article requirements and enhance the robustness of their scholarly efforts.",

      "abstractNote": "Research frequently uses the quantitative approach to explore undergraduate students’ anxiety regarding statistics. However, few studies of adults’ statistics anxiety use the qualitative method, or a sole focus on graduate students. Moreover, even fewer studies focus on a comparison of adults’ anxiety levels before and after an introductory statistics course. This line of study is important to pursue, since the introductory statistics course should play very important roles of both preparing students’ foundation knowledge and inspiring their interests for a higher-level course. In addition, graduate students tend to have different backgrounds, learning motivations, and learning habits, compared to their undergraduate counterparts. Overall, limited mixed research method is available on social sciences graduate students’ (1) statistics anxiety before and after the introductory statistics course, and (2) actions taken to decrease the anxiety. This study seeks to fill this gap by incorporating a mixed research method in order to explore social sciences graduate students’ statistics learning processes. Findings suggest that the social sciences graduate students’ anxiety levels tend to diminish after the introductory statistics course, even though these also experience severe statistics anxiety at the very beginning. These findings become essential for institutions, higher education instructors, and social sciences statistics learners to consider.",

      "abstractNote": "Are adjunct faculty a valued and necessary teaching resource at institutions of higher education, or are they really just a source of cheap labor? Both viewpoints, along with many in between, can be found in the literature regarding the use of adjunct faculty or part-time instructors in today’s colleges and universities. What is also evident in the literature is the sense that “those faculty members are critical to the financial and programmatic viability of their institutions” (Ellison, 2002, p.3). It appears that colleges and universities would not be able to remain open without adjunct faculty; part-time instructors now constitute approximately 50% of the total professoriate in this country (Jacoby, 2006; Schneider, 1999). Yet it seems that many adjuncts still do not receive the respect they deserve or the support they need to do their jobs properly, from either their full-time colleagues or the administration. Could they be considered the last marginalized group on American campuses? It is an issue that needs to be addressed in order to maintain the integrity of the American postsecondary institution and quality education for all students.",

      "abstractNote": "The propensity score is the probability of treatment assignment conditional on observed baseline characteristics. The propensity score allows one to design and analyze an observational (nonrandomized) study so that it mimics some of the particular characteristics of a randomized controlled trial. In particular, the propensity score is a balancing score: conditional on the propensity score, the distribution of observed baseline covariates will be similar between treated and untreated subjects. I describe 4 different propensity score methods: matching on the propensity score, stratification on the propensity score, inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score, and covariate adjustment using the propensity score. I describe balance diagnostics for examining whether the propensity score model has been adequately specified. Furthermore, I discuss differences between regression-based methods and propensity score-based methods for the analysis of observational data. I describe different causal average treatment effects and their relationship with propensity score analyses.",
